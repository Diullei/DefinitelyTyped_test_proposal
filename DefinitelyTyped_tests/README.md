DefinitelyTyped Tests
=====================

To execute all DefinitelyTyped tests use the following steps:

1. On root folder execute 

	`npm install`

2. Execute the following command to run all tests:

	`./node_modules/.bin/jake runtests`

> NOTE for Windows user: If you are not in a PowerShell command prompt use the command `.\node_modules\.bin\jake runtests` instead the command above.	

This will generate an html file named `test-result.html` on DefinitelyTyped root folder.
